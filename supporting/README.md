The file in this folder are NOT necessary to reproduce the example, when going step by step.
But they can help, if things do not work as expected:
* DATEX_II_Situation_v3.qea is only needed, if you want to produce the v4 version yourself (this is an extra task, and necessary at all)
* Datex II v4 UML Profile Export.xmi is only neede in case above.
* DATEX_II_Situation_v4.qea is also not needed, because it is already present in the demo version tool.
* The 4 .json files are produced during the step-by-step procedure with the demo-tool. You can shorten the process (not using the tool) by directly using these files.
