The file in this folder are NOT necessary to reproduce the example, when going step by step.
But they can help, if things do not work as expected:
* DATEX_II_Situation_v3.qea is only needed, if you want to produce the v4 version yourself (this is an extra task, and not necessary at all)
* Datex II v4 UML Profile Export.xmi is only needed in case described above. Note that this profile is not officially released and might be subject of change.
* DATEX_II_Situation_v4.qea is also not needed, because it is already present in the demo version tool. Note that this model of v4 is not officially released and WILL(!) be subject of change.
* The 4 .json files are produced during the step-by-step procedure with the demo-tool. You can shorten the process (not using the tool) by directly using these files.
