# UF2024-DATEX-II-Future

Exploring the future of DATEX II

Workshop leader: JÃ¶rg Freudenstein
The workshop is done together with Ian, Paal and Jonas

We will present planned and envisaged methodologies and features of DATEX II,

and the participants are engaged to bring in their own ideas for the future development. On a practical technical example, we will show some planned possibilities of the DATEX II version 4 methodology like Entities and APIs. Filtering requests will be served by a test server, so that participants can re-enact at home.
